<h2>What is <i>rate limiting</i>?</h2>

Rate limiting is a strategy for limiting network traffic. It puts a cap on how often someone can repeat an action within a certain timeframe – for instance, trying to log in to an account. </br>
Rate limiting can help stop certain kinds of malicious bot activity. It can also reduce strain on web servers. </br>
However, rate limiting is not a complete solution for managing bot activity. </br>

<h3>What kinds of bot attacks are stopped by rate limiting?</h3>

Rate limiting is often employed to stop bad bots from negatively impacting a website or application. Bot attacks that rate limiting can help mitigate include:

    - Brute force attacks
    - DoS and DDoS attacks
    - Web scraping

Rate limiting also protects against API overuse, which is not necessarily malicious or due to bot activity, but is important to prevent nonetheless.

> [!NOTE] 
> When bypassing rate limits, make sure you find the correct methods/variables to do so, or you might lose access to the api/app. </br>
> Avoiding rate limits is hard and tedious. Good luck!

> [!CAUTION]
> I'm not telling you to bypass rate limits, I just do it for fun as some apps have horrible rate limit systems. </br>
> If you do decide to do this, dont do it on a big company/app as you might get into some issues...
> I take no responsibility for anything you do to any apps rate limits.
