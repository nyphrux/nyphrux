<details>
  <summary><b>Gorilla Tag</b></summary>
	
I mainly make plugins/mods for Gorilla Tag as it is very easy to do and everything is directly exposed.

Here are somne of my Gorilla Tag plugins/mods:

<h2>Slapsy >> https://github.com/nyphrux/slapsy</h2>
> A silly mod allowing you to slap monkeys! </br>
> Just slap them, and they will be slapped! It's that simple! </br>
> [!CAUTION]
> This mod sends RPC packets to the server when you slap monkeys. If you are in a server using PelicanAC or send too many slaps you may get kicked, or worse, banned. Use at your own risk!
> I am not responsible for any bans or kicks you may receive from using this mod. Please use it responsibly and have fun slapping monkeys!

<h2>GorillaProt >> https://github.com/nyphrux/GorillaProt</h2>
> Protects your game/user from bad stuff. </br>
> Gorilla prot protects you from: </br>
> - Stump Kicks </br>
> - Crashes </br>
> - Ban Crashes </br>
>
> Gorilla prot also: </br>
> - Clears cache every 60s </br>

> [!NOTE] 
> GorillaProt may be an illegal mod as it breaks some GorillaTag rules and abuses some systems implamented on purpose.
